# Bacterial Visualization

## Purpose
### About the Study
The food startup "Improbable Beef" has partnered with a lab to study bacterial species. Their goal is to identify bacterial species that can synthesize proteins to improve the taste of their synthetic beef products.\
Bacteria found on the human body varies between body part and person. This study collected data from samples of study participants of the bacteria found in their navel.
### About the Dashboard
With the interactive charts, you can explore the types and amounts of bacteria cultures found in the sample of each participant.\
The dashboard includes a dropdown menu to select any participant from the study by their assigned number. You can then see the 10 most populous bacteria found in their sample, their navel washing frequency in a gauge chart, and an interactive bubble chart where each bubble represents one type of bacteria found in their sample and the size of the bubbles represents the amount of that bacteria found.
